  abstract = {Understanding spatial population dynamics is fundamental
                  for many questions in ecology and
                  conservation(1-4). Many theoretical mechanisms have
                  been proposed whereby spatial structure can promote
                  population persistence, in particular for
                  exploiter-victim systems (host-parasite/pathogen,
                  predator-prey) whose interactions are inherently
                  oscillatory and therefore prone to extinction of
                  local populations(5-11). Experiments have confirmed
                  that spatial structure can extend
                  persistence(11-16), but it has rarely been possible
                  to identify the specific mechanisms involved. Here
                  we use a model-based approach to identify the
                  effects of spatial population processes in
                  experimental systems of bean plants (Phaseolus
                  lunatus), herbivorous mites (Tetranychus urticae)
                  and predatory mites (Phytoseiulus  persimilis). On
                  isolated plants, and in a spatially undivided
                  experimental system of 90 plants, prey and predator
                  populations collapsed; however, introducing habitat
                  structure allowed long-term persistence. Using
                  mechanistic models, we determine that spatial
                  population structure did not contribute to
                  persistence, and spatially explicit models are not
                  needed. Rather, habitat structure reduced the
                  success of predators at locating prey outbreaks,
                  allowing between-plant asynchrony of local
                  population cycles due to random colonization events.}
